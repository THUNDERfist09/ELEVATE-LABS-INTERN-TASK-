Step 1: Gathering Information (Reconnaissance)
Target Identification: You used a tool called "Hunter.io" to find an email address.

Information Extraction: You located an email address for a person named "Farrel Farhoudi" with the email farhoudi@apple.com. This is a crucial piece of information for making the spoofed email appear legitimate.

Step 2: Setting up the Phishing Campaign
Creating the Email Spoof: You used an online "Fake Mailer" tool, specifically "EMKEI's MAILER."

Crafting the Deceptive Email: You filled out the mailer with the following details:

From Name: Farrel Farhoudi

From E-mail: farhoudi@apple.com (This is the spoofed sender, making it appear to come from a legitimate Apple employee).

To: diyadim360@dekpai.com (This is your temporary email address, used to receive the test email).

Subject: "URGENT: Your Account Has Been Compromised - Action Required Immediately" (This creates a sense of urgency).

Body Text: You wrote a message explaining that "unusual activity" was detected and that the recipient must "secure your account" by clicking a link. You included a malicious-looking URL in the text: http://www.secure-my-account.co/login/verify-info?id=12345.

Step 3: Sending and Receiving the Phishing Email
Sending the Email: You sent the spoofed email using the "EMKEI's MAILER" tool.

Receiving the Email: You accessed the temporary email service "Temp-Mail" to receive the email you just sent. The screenshot shows the email in your temporary inbox, appearing to be from "Farrel Farhoudi" and "farhoudi@apple.com," with the urgent subject line.

Examining the Email: You opened the email within the temporary mail service to view its full content, confirming that the spoofing and the malicious link were successfully delivered.

Step 4: Verifying the Malicious Link
URL Analysis: You copied the suspicious URL from the phishing email.

Using a Security Tool: You used "VirusTotal," a reputable security analysis service, to check the URL.

Confirmation of Maliciousness: The VirusTotal scan of the URL http://apple-login.com/ (a likely redirect or the final destination of the phishing link) confirmed that multiple security vendors flagged it as "Phishing" or "Malicious." This proves that the link is a known threat and not a legitimate page.

Conclusion:

This series of steps effectively demonstrates a full ethical hacking process for a phishing simulation, from initial reconnaissance to crafting and sending a spoofed email, and finally, to verifying that the associated link is malicious. This process highlights the ease with which attackers can create convincing phishing emails and the importance of security awareness, such as checking sender addresses and using tools like VirusTotal to analyze suspicious links.
